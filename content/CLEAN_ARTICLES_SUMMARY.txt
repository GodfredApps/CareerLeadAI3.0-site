BLOG ARTICLES - CLEAN VERSION WITH CTAs
========================================

STATUS: READY TO COPY-PASTE INTO SANITY

Location: /content/blog-articles-clean/

---

WHAT I'VE DONE:

1. REMOVED ALL MARKDOWN FORMATTING
   ✓ No asterisks for bold/italic
   ✓ No backticks for code
   ✓ No quote marks around examples
   ✓ Plain text that copies cleanly

2. ADDED STRATEGIC CTAs
   ✓ 6-10 CTAs per article
   ✓ Contextual to content
   ✓ Brand-aligned messaging
   ✓ Strong final call-to-action

3. CTA HOOKS USED:
   ✓ "Generate Your Career Path"
   ✓ "Start Managing Your Career Today"
   ✓ "Get AI-Powered Recommendations"
   ✓ "Take Action Now"
   ✓ "Transform Your Career"
   ✓ "Discover Your Ideal Path"

SAMPLE ARTICLE COMPLETED:

Article 1: Highest Paying Jobs in Ghana 2025
File: highest-paying-jobs-ghana-2025-clean.txt
Status: ✓ READY
CTAs: 8 throughout + 1 strong final
Format: Plain text, no formatting issues

CTA Examples from this article:

Mid-article CTA:
"Ready to transition into tech? CareerLead AI can map your path from your current role to IT management. Start your career transformation now."

Contextual CTA:
"Not sure which path fits you best? Take CareerLead AI's skill assessment to discover your strengths and ideal career matches."

Strong Final CTA:
"START MANAGING YOUR CAREER TODAY - Generate your personalized career roadmap with CareerLead AI in under 5 minutes."

REMAINING 4 ARTICLES:

Due to length constraints, I recommend:

OPTION A: I create abbreviated versions now (2,000-3,000 words each with CTAs)
OPTION B: You use the first article as a template and add CTAs to the others
OPTION C: I create them one at a time as separate requests

The first article shows the exact format you need:
- No special characters
- Clean copy-paste
- Strategic CTA placement
- Brand-aligned messaging

CTA BUTTON IMPLEMENTATION (FOR DEVELOPER):

After publishing articles, add clickable CTA buttons in the blog post template:

Location: /app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx

Example CTA Button Component:

<CTAButton
  text="Generate Your Career Path"
  link="/generate-career-paths"
  style="primary"
  icon="arrow-right"
/>

Button should:
- Use brand teal color (#14b8a6)
- White text
- Hover effect (darker teal)
- Track click events in Google Analytics

CTA PLACEMENT STRATEGY:

Early Hook (After Introduction):
Captures engaged readers early

Mid-Content CTAs (After High-Value Sections):
Reader has seen value, ready to act

Pre-Conclusion CTA:
Reader finished learning, time to act

Final Strong CTA:
Last chance to convert

---

ANALYTICS TO TRACK:

For each article, track:
1. CTA click-through rate
2. Time to first CTA click
3. Which CTAs perform best
4. Scroll depth when CTA clicked
5. Conversion rate (CTA click → signup)

This data will help optimize future articles.
