## Salary Negotiation Templates

### **When Receiving an Offer (Below Expectations)**

```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

Thank you for the offer for the Senior Software Engineer position. I'm excited
about the opportunity to contribute to [Company].

After reviewing the offer ($30,000/year), I'd like to discuss the compensation.
Based on my 6 years of experience in React and Node.js, and market research
showing senior developers with similar skills earning $38,000-$45,000 in [City],
I was expecting a range closer to $40,000.

I'm confident I can deliver significant value through [specific contribution].
Could we explore adjusting the base salary or enhancing other components of
the total compensation package?

I'm happy to discuss further. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

---

### **Annual Review Salary Increase Request**

```
Dear [Manager],

I'd like to request a meeting to discuss my compensation as part of our
annual review process.

Over the past year, I've:
• Led the development of [Project], which increased [metric] by 40%
• Mentored 3 junior developers, improving team productivity
• Implemented CI/CD pipeline, reducing deployment time by 60%

Market research shows developers with my experience and skill set (React,
AWS, 5 years) earning $35,000-$42,000. My current salary of $28,000 is
below this range.

I'm requesting an increase to $38,000 to align with market rates and
reflect my contributions. I'm open to discussing a performance-based
path to reach this level if an immediate adjustment isn't feasible.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I earn a good salary as a self-taught developer in Africa?**
A: Yes. Many top-earning developers in Africa are self-taught. Employers increasingly value skills and portfolios over degrees. Build a strong GitHub profile and portfolio to demonstrate competence.

**Q: Should I accept equity as part of my compensation?**
A: Only if the base salary is fair. Equity is a gamble—most startups fail. If you join an early-stage startup, ensure you can live on the base salary alone. Treat equity as a potential bonus, not guaranteed income.

**Q: How much should I expect as an annual salary increase?**
A: Average annual increases in African tech companies range from 5-10%. However, changing jobs can get you 20-40% increases. Consider switching companies every 2-3 years for optimal salary growth.

**Q: Do remote jobs for international companies really pay 2-4x more?**
A: Yes, for skilled developers. Platforms like Andela, Toptal, and Turing place African developers at $3,000-$8,000/month with US/European companies. However, competition is high—you need strong skills and excellent English.

**Q: Which programming language should I learn to maximize salary?**
A: For **highest demand:** JavaScript (React/Node.js). For **highest pay:** Go, Scala, or specialize in cloud/DevOps. Balance between market demand and salary premium.

**Q: Is it worth relocating within Africa for a higher salary?**
A: Consider total compensation and cost of living. Moving from Lagos to Johannesburg might triple your USD salary, but living costs are also higher. Calculate net savings after expenses.
